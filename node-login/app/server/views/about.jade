						| Througout the city of Philadelphia, neighborhoods are organized around a network of block captains (1-2 per city block). There are also often several community
						| organizations serving sections of the neighborhood. Block captains are residents who has taken on the role of information dissemination of their block. They organize
						| clean up activities, share information about events in the area, and hold meetings along with other services. Neiborhood groups sometimes use them to get information
						| to residents.

						| The Point Breeze area of Philadelphia is the home of approximately 84,000 residents. Within this area, there are between 250 to 300 individual blocks,
						|       each having 1 or 2 block captain. Overall coordination is currently disjointed and managed by several folks who are using pen and paper to track which captain
						|       belong to each block. The information is currently difficult to maintain and getting information to the captains is not efficient or effective.
