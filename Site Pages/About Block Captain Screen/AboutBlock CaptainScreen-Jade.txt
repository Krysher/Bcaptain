            | Througout the city of Philadelphia, neighborhoods are organized around a network of block captins (1-2 per city block). There are also often several community
            | organizations serving sections of the neighborhood. Block captins are residents who has taken on the role of information dissemination of their block. They organize
            | clean up activities, share information about events in the area, and hold meetings along with other services. Neiborhood groups sometimes use them to get information
            | to residents.

            | The Point Breeze area of Philadelphia is the home of approximately 84,000 residents. Within this area, there are between 250 to 300 individual blocks,
            |       each having 1 or 2 block captin. Overall coordination is currently disjointed and managed by several folks who are using pen and paper to track which captin
            |       belong to each block. The information is currently difficult to maintain and getting information to the captins is not efficient or effective.
